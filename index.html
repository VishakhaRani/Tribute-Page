                    <div id="para1">Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American
                                computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.One of the first programmers of the
                                Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the
                                first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which
                                led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</div> 
                    <div id="para2">
                        She received a master’s degree (1930) and a Ph.D. (1934) in mathematics from Yale. One of the first
                        three modern “programmers,” Hopper is best known for her trailblazing contributions to the development
                        of computer languages. Known as irreverent, sharp-tongued, and brilliant, she enjoyed long and influential
                        careers in both the U.S. Navy and the private sector.

                    <div id="para3">Hopper came of age at a time of unusual opportunity for women. A relatively high number of women
                     were receiving doctorates in the 1920s and 1930s — numbers that would not be matched again until the 1980s.
                      World War II also created opportunities for women to enter the workforce in greater numbers. Nonetheless,
                    Hopper’s success in a male-dominated field and in male-dominated organizations, including the U.S. Navy, was exceptional.

                    <div id="para4">You've probably heard of the term 'bug' when it comes to computer systems.
                     But have you ever wondered where the term came from? The answer, it turns out, is actually
                    satisfyingly simple. When the first computers were developed they were a mixture of mechanical
                     and electrical systems that often formed large, 'hulking' heat generating machines.
                      These machines consumed large volumes of space in rooms and the warmth they generated often attracted insects to their internal components. </div>
                    <div id="para5">The story goes that a moth crawled between the computer's 'gubbins' and got stuck
                     within one of its relay's causing it to malfunction. Hence the use of the term 'bug'.
                      The term computer/software ‘bugs’ had been used before Grace's time, but after Grace Hopper wrote
                       in her diary “first actual case of bug being found” the term became really popular, and that’s why,
                        in part, we are still using it today. Well, at least that's the usual story behind the term. In fact,
                         although Grace was part of the team she never actually found the fabled moth behind the term.
